<h1><b>Virtual Object Control 3D - C++ Code<b/></h1>

<h2><b>Short description</b></h2>
<p>
Modern technologies in the field of computer science allow user interaction with the computer and other parts of the body except the hands. This improvement helps users who have a disease with their hands, to use the computer with other parts of their body, without realizing an obstacle to the elaboration of the activities they wish to perform. However, the implementation of the method does not stop here, but extends to various other fields such as modern computer games, where the player is wearing a special headset and is moving around in a virtual environment in which there are various objects and creatures with which he is interacting, by performing a series of specific movements with his body.
</p>
<p>
In this project, the interaction of a user in a virtual world gets demonstrated using a special 3D camera from Intel. Using this camera, the user's head posture gets translated in a predetermined movement in the virtual world e.g. when the user moves towards the screen this gets translated in a moving forward operation in the virtual environment.
